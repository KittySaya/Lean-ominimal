# Lean-ominimal
Formalizing the proof that the set of real numbers equipped with the binary less-than relation forms a O-minimal structure.
Written as a project for the course Formal Methods in Mathematics.

# Structure
- **Formula** defines all the formula types as well as giving conversions between them.
- **Formula.Realize** gives an interpetation to a formula for the different formula types.
- **ominimality** proves that the real numbers is ominimal.
- **Definability.Left** and **Definability.Right** proof both parts of the biimplication.
- **DLO** defines what a dense linear order is.
